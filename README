The function `hide-region-hide' hides the region. You can hide
many different regions and they will be "marked" by two
configurable strings (so that you know where the hidden text is).

The hidden regions is pushed on a kind of hide-region \"ring".

The function `hide-region-unhide' "unhides" one region, starting
with the last one you hid.

The best is to try it out. Test on the following:

Test region 1
Test region 2
Test region 3

If you are annoyed by the text getting "stuck" inside the hidden
regions, call the function `hide-region-setup-keybindings' to
setup local keybindings to a couple of functions trying to be
smart and guessing if the point is inside a hidden region and if
so, move out of it in the correct direction.
